As a final project for CS50x, I've decided to create my own portfolio website, which I plan to keep using after the course as I progress with learning Data Analytics and add more projects.

## CSS:
- Using Bootstrap CSS framework.
- Using CSS Flexbox layout.
- Modifying details in my styles.css file.
