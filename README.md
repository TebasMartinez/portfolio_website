#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
## Description:
\[ WORK IN PROGRESS \] \
As a final project for CS50x, I've decided to create my own portfolio website, which I plan to keep using after the course as I progress with learning Data Analytics and add more projects.

## HTML:


## CSS:
- **Used Bootstrap CSS framework.**
- **Used CSS Flexbox layout.**
- **Created styles.css file:**
  - Comment-divided sections for readability.
  - :root pseudo-class to include colour palette.
  - Added styles to header, body, and footer tags.
  - Edited styles to some bootstrap classes: border-success, nav-link (+ nav-link:hover, nav-link.active), card, card-img-top, card-body, btn, contactform.
  - Added styles to self-defined classes: one-line, project-container, project-card-row, intro-card.
  - Used @media for different behaviour on desktop.
- **Colour palette:** \

Used coolors.co to define my site's palette: https://coolors.co/edcbb1-8af3ff-82972f-19535f-413a3b


## JavaScript
- **Used Bootstrap's tab JavaScript plugin.**
  - Added navigational tabs with tabbable panes of local content inside one of the cards for skills, education, and online courses sections in about.html
