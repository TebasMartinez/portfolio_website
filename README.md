# PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
## Description:
\[ WORK IN PROGRESS \] \
As a final project for CS50x, I've decided to create my own portfolio website, which I plan to keep using after the course as I progress with learning Data Analytics and add more projects.

## HTML:

The portfolio website contains 6 HTML files that allow for easy navigation between pages using a [bootstrap navigation bar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/).

- Shared elements
All files include the header and the footer, providing a consistent site experience.

- index.html
Contains the portfolio homepage. A clean page showing projects portfolio displayed with [bootstrap cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/).
- about.html
Contains professional information: intro, skills, education, and experience. Uses [bootstrap Flush lists](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/list-group/#flush)




## CSS:
- **Used Bootstrap CSS framework.**
- **Used CSS Flexbox layout.**
- **Created styles.css file:**
  - Comment-divided sections for readability.
  - :root pseudo-class to include colour palette.
  - Added styles to header, body, and footer tags.
  - Edited styles to some bootstrap classes.
  - Added styles to self-defined classes.
  - Used @media for different styles on desktop and mobile on some elements.
- **Colour palette:** \

Used coolors.co to define my site's palette: https://coolors.co/edcbb1-8af3ff-82972f-19535f-413a3b


## JavaScript
- **Used Bootstrap's tab JavaScript plugin.**
  - Added navigational tabs with tabbable panes of local content inside one of the cards for skills, education, and online courses sections in about.html
    - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/#navigation
    - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navs-tabs/#javascript-behavior
- **Created JavaScript file for thankyou page personalization.**
  - After the contact form is used, JavaScripts edits the text in the thank you page to add the user's name. Safety measures have been taken to avoid JS injection: encoding input before adding it to URL, and then sanitizing the value taken and only including it in the page with .textContent

## Favicon
- Created the image with Canva and adapted it into the different sizes of a favicon package with [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)

## Compliance
The website complies with local legal requirements including an Impressum and a Datenschutzerkl√§rung.
